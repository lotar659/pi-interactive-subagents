/**
 * Extension loaded into sub-agents.
 * - Shows agent identity + available tools as a styled widget above the editor (toggle with Ctrl+Alt+O)
 * - Provides an `ask_question` tool for asking the parent orchestrator a question
 *
 * Subagents do NOT self-terminate via a tool. Auto-exit agents shut down
 * automatically when their agent loop ends (see the `agent_end` handler);
 * interactive agents end when the human exits the pane.
 *
 * `ask_question` keeps the session OPEN: it writes a `${sessionFile}.ask`
 * signal the parent's watcher picks up, parks the session in a "waiting" state
 * (auto-exit is suppressed for that turn via `awaitingAnswer`), and the parent
 * replies with subagent_message — which lands as the subagent's next turn.
 *
 * A provider/connection error keeps the session OPEN too. When auto-retry is
 * exhausted the turn ends with `stopReason: "error"`, which pi itself treats as
 * a normal (recoverable) end of turn in an interactive session. Auto-exit is
 * therefore suppressed for that turn as well: the subagent parks in "waiting",
 * writes a `${sessionFile}.attention` signal, and the parent can steer a retry
 * into the live session instead of resuming it from a cold start.
 *
 * `agent_end` fires for EVERY attempt, including the ones pi is about to retry
 * automatically (a retry continues the run and emits a fresh `agent_start`).
 * The `.attention` signal is therefore only written on `agent_settled`, which
 * fires once after the whole run — retries included — has finished.
